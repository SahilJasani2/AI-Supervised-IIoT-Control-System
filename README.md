# AI-Supervised IIoT Control System

A complete, Docker-based IIoT template for building a robust, intelligent industrial control system. This project uses multi-sensor fusion via an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and demonstrates how an AI agent can supervise a traditional PID controller based on a fused health estimate.

## Architecture: AI-Supervised PID Control

This project demonstrates a hybrid control architecture, a core pattern for modern industrial automation.

### The PID Controller (The Worker)
A standard PID controller runs a tight, closed-loop operation. Its only job is to maintain the motor's speed at a given setpoint (e.g., 1500 RPM) by constantly adjusting the output voltage.

### The AI Agent (The Supervisor)
An unsupervised Autoencoder model acts as a "digital twin," monitoring the motor's health based on a fused state estimate (vibration and temperature) provided by the EKF. It does not control the motor directly. Instead, when it detects a developing fault, it acts as a supervisor.

### The Action
Upon detecting an anomaly, the AI publishes a command. The PID controller receives this command and changes its setpoint to a safe, lower value (e.g., 500 RPM), automatically bringing the system to a stable, safe state.

## Features

- **Realistic Data Simulation**: Simulates a motor's speed and a non-linear degradation process across multiple sensors (vibration and temperature) with realistic noise.
- **Multi-Sensor Fusion & State Estimation (EKF)**: Implements an Extended Kalman Filter to fuse noisy data from multiple sensors (vibration and temperature) into a single, robust health state estimate.
- **Closed-Loop PID Control**: A PID controller actively manages the motor's speed to match a dynamic setpoint.
- **AI-Powered Supervision**: A PyTorch-based Autoencoder detects anomalies and intelligently modifies the PID controller's goal based on the fused sensor data.
- **Fully Containerized**: The entire stack is managed by Docker Compose for one-command startup.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop installed and running

### Installation & Launch

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal
3. Run the following command to build the Docker images and start all services:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

The entire pipeline is now running.

- **View the Dashboard**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (login: `admin`/`password`)
- **Explore the Database**: [http://localhost:8086](http://localhost:8086) (login: `admin`/`password123`)

### Stopping the Application

To stop all running containers, run:

```bash
docker-compose down
```
